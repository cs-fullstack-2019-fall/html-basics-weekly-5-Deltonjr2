The Friday 09/06/2019 project 5 is interesting. We are asked to Reproduce the google search page.

    The way that I want to approach this project is to first add the appropriate CSS link to my HTML document then copy the google image and paste that in HTML. Next I will click  the buttons on the google page to see if they work and copy code to input the buttons in HTML.

    The next thing I want to to do is add the words from the google site which are "About", "store", "google search", "Im'feeling lucky"," Gmail", "Images","Advertising", "Business", "How Search works"PrivacyTerms. The site also has an option to add your picture". I will try and upload my photo or use Kevin's picture included in the text. I found that the I'm lucky does not work so that button will not be included in my project.
